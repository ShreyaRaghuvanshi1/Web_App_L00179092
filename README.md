## Introduction

Serverless computing offers scalability and reduced operational overhead, but it can also introduce performance challenges. This project investigates the root causes of these performance issues when serverless applications are integrated into a DevOps pipeline, aiming to provide empirical data and practical solutions.

## Research Objective

The primary objective of this research is to:
1. Design a CI/CD pipeline to identify potential performance bottlenecks.
2. Develop and deploy a serverless application to analyze its performance degradation.
3. Identify the root causes of performance issues in serverless applications within a DevOps environment.

## Technologies and Tools Used

- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless function execution.
- **Jenkins**: For continuous integration and continuous deployment.
- **SAM CLI**: For building and deploying serverless applications.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: For infrastructure as code.
- **AWS CloudWatch & X-Ray**: For monitoring and logging.
- **Artillery.io**: For performance testing and load simulation.
- **Node.js**: For application development and testing.

## Architecture

The project is structured as follows:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Includes tools like Jenkins for automation, GitHub for version control, and SAM CLI for deploying serverless applications.
2. **Serverless Application**: Deployed on AWS Lambda, using services such as API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Cognito for various functionalities.
3. **Monitoring and Testing**: Leveraging AWS CloudWatch and X-Ray for monitoring, with performance tests conducted using Artillery.io.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/serverless-devops-performance.git
   cd serverless-devops-performance
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js and AWS CLI installed.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up AWS Credentials**:
   Configure your AWS CLI with the necessary credentials.

4. **Deploy the Application**:
   Use SAM CLI to build and deploy the application.
   ```bash
   sam build
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run CI/CD Pipeline**:
   Set up Jenkins to automate the deployment process.
   Refer to `Jenkinsfile` in the repository for the pipeline configuration.

2. **Perform Load Testing**:
   Use Artillery.io to simulate load on the deployed application.
   ```bash
   artillery run load_test.yml
   ```

3. **Monitor Application**:
   Monitor the application's performance via AWS CloudWatch and X-Ray dashboards.

## Results

The findings of this thesis reveal several key factors contributing to performance issues. These include throttling due to rate limiting, resource exhaustion, payload handling issues, and cold starts. Throttling and rate limiting occur as the system nears concurrency limits, leading to increased HTTP 403 errors. Resource exhaustion is indicated by higher p95 and p99 response times under load, suggesting limits in memory, CPU, or connections. Handling oversized or malformed payloads strains the system, increasing latency and errors. Cold starts add to performance issues by causing delays when new instances are initialized. Lastly, improper memory allocation further impacts performance, highlighting the need for optimized resource management and scaling.

## Conclusion

This research provides valuable insights into the performance challenges of serverless applications within a DevOps pipeline. By understanding and mitigating these issues, developers can ensure more reliable and efficient serverless deployments.
